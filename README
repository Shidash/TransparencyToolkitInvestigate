This is a platform for collaborative investigation with tools to help with collection, analysis, and release of data. Currently it is mostly a system for defining what info you need and collecting it, but some of the first set of analysis tools work if you upload a JSON file with emails in it. See http://transparencytoolkit.org for more information.
