They have accepted they had consensual sex\n   with Assange, but one claims that he managed a repeat without a condom\n   while she was allegedly asleep, ie without her consent.\n   We will have to await the more sordid details, but the evidence does not\n   seem to justify banging him up in one of London's least hospitable\n   prisons, or indeed denying him bail.\n   It might have been wiser for the UK authorities to allow him bail, but\n   take away his passport - then he and his operation would be fully exposed\n   to a media feeding frenzy, and some pertinent questioning\n   On 14/12/2010, at 9:33 AM, Sean Noonan wrote:\n     when was the last time the US ran a successful honey trap?

There is now ample evidence that the Wikileaks publishing operation was centred in the UK.\n There is little doubt that Assange has damaged the interests of the United States, but there are plenty of other residents of the UK that have done that, but because their acts have not been carried out in the US, they remain untouched. As I understand it there is no evidence Assange has been in the US.\n There is an extradition treaty between the US and UK, but it has not been without controversy in recent years. It also has a get out clause in that it is possible to argue against extradition if the request is deemed to \"be a \"political offence\".  Assange's lawyers, said to include the formidable politico lawyer, Geoffrey Robertson, QC, will certainly argue that.\n The UK courts are also wary of espionage related charges after the drubbing they had in the Spycatcher case, which trimmed the almost universal power the government had in such matters. In 1985,Peter Wright a retired  assistant director of MI5 wrote Spycatcher from his retirement home in Tasmania. (Like Assange he was an Australian citizen). It disclosed that Roger Hollis, the former director general of MI5 was a Soviet mole at the height of the cold war, that the CIA and MI5 plotted against former Prime Minster Harold Wilson, and a variety of other disclosures. While in volume, these disclosures were small compared with WikiLeaks, they had a sensational impact at the time. The book was banned in Britain, and newspapers were served orders forbidding extracting from it. Wright was never prosecuted, and after the House of Lords and the Court of Appeal reinforced the ban, the European Court of Human Rights overturned the ruling.

At the time there were calls for Wright to be brought to trial in England that were at least as vociferous as those now against Assange, but he never was.\n If Assange were to return to his country of citizenship, it is unlikely the Australian government would cooperate with an extradition attempt. The foreign minister Kevin Rudd has already offered him full consular support, and has ordered envoys in London with a laptop. This is a bit of a joke - as he will hardly get wifi in Wandsworth Prison. The Australian Attorney General has been derided for suggesting Assange's Australian citizenship could be revoked, since he was born here.\n And if he goes to Sweden, the Swedish judiciary will have their eyes on the European Court ofHuman Rights.\n             -- \n             Sean Noonan\n             Tactical Analyst\n             Office: +1 512-279-9479\n             Mobile: +1 512-758-5967\n             Strategic Forecasting, Inc.\n             www.stratfor.com\n           -- \n           George Friedman\n           Founder and CEO\n           Stratfor\n           700 Lavaca Street\n           Suite 900\n           Austin, Texas 78701\n           Phone  512-744-4319\n           Fax  512-744-4334\n         -- \n         Sean Noonan\n         Tactical Analyst\n         Office: +1 512-279-9479\n         Mobile: +1 512-758-5967\n         Strategic Forecasting, Inc.\n         www.stratfor.com\n     --\n     Sean Noonan\n     Tactical Analyst\n     Office: +1 512-279-9479\n     Mobile: +1 512-758-5967\n     Strategic Forecasting, Inc.\n     www.stratfor.com"
