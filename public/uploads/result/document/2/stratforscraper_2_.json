No doubt, Turkey, along with Brazil, China, India and South\n   Africa, is on the upswing while the US and many European states are\n   struggling to cope with the shifting ground beneath their feet. The\n   economic woes of the West are merely a sign of what may be coming further\n   down the road.\n   When you look at history, Turkey has always aligned itself with a single\n   major European power to stay closely involved in the continent's affairs.\n   At different times, two nations have emerged as leading candidates for\n   Turks in Europe to build alliances to further the interests of Ottoman\n   Turks. One was France in the first quarter of the 16th century, during\n   which the Kingdom of France under the Valois king, Francis I, sought\n   critical assistance and alliance from the then superpower, the Ottoman\n   Empire, ruled by Su:leyman the Magnificent.\n   The second was Germany during World War I when both countries made an\n   alliance and fought on the side of the Central Powers. The Ottoman Empire,\n   which was in decline and had weakened by the time, was used by the Germans\n   to open new fronts against both the Russians and the British. With German\n   assistance to beef up their army, Ottoman Turks fought the Russians in the\n   Caucasus, and the British and French in Gallipoli, the Middle East and\n   Africa.\n   During the Cold War era, however, Turkey heavily relied on the US as a\n   major ally and became disentangled from the France-Germany axis, opting to\n   manage European affairs through US bidding rather than direct involvement\n   with Europe. What is more, the picture changed dramatically in Europe with\n   former foes France and Germany forging an alliance between themselves,\n   starting with the European Coal and Steel Community in 1950, a precursor\n   to the European Union.\n   Today I think we are about to witness a change in the design of the\n   European balance of power, and many wonder which one, France or Germany,\n   will fold first with new overtures towards Turkey. My bet is the Germans\n   will be inclined to develop a strong bond with Turkey and rush to\n   capitalize on already existing potential.\n   Though opposed to the idea of Turkey's full membership to the EU,\n   Chancellor Angela Merkel has kept the damage to bilateral ties at a\n   minimum and refrained from harsh comments, unlike French President Nicolas\n   Sarkozy, who made a fool of himself playing domestic politics with Turkey.\n   The circumstances have changed dramatically for Turkey this time around as\n   well. Turkey has developed strong ties with the Nordic bloc as well as\n   with European countries along the Mediterranean rim, with the exception of\n   France. Spain, Portugal and Italy are strong supporters of Turkey's closer\n   involvement in European affairs, hoping that Turkey will help balance the\n   French-German influence on the continent. The Nordic bloc wants to promote\n   ties with Turkey to stay relevant in regional affairs, ranging from Middle\n   East affairs to problems in the Balkans, and also want to keep economic\n   interests in the booming consumer markets in Turkey and its immediate\n   neighborhood.\n   But the game changer would be a possible divergence of French and German\n   interests in the future. We have already seen how the deepening\n   Franco-German row over bailout funding caused a deadlock for months in\n   talks on how to solve the 27-nation bloc's burgeoning debt crisis before\n   they agreed on a deal this week. I think Germany, possibly under new\n   leadership after Merkel, may search for new partners in Europe. That does\n   not mean of course that Germany will drop France altogether. That is quite\n   unlikely considering how robust the France-Germany economic partnership\n   is. But sticking with only France as its major partner would not be enough\n   to sustain German interests in the future. Some analysts believe that\n   Germany should enlist Russian and Turkish help in order to maintain German\n   influence in European affairs for the foreseeable future. But for that to\n   happen Germany needs to revise its policy vis-`a-vis both Russia and\n   Turkey, two major players in Europe with substantial political and\n   economic ties with each other.\n   There is already a considerable basis upon which we can build stronger\n   German-Turkish cooperation. But the problem is that we simply do not know\n   how to capitalize on that potential because of a deep mutual distrust on\n   both sides as well as the shortsighted policies of Merkel's conservative\n   Christian Democratic Union (CDU) government. For example, this week we are\n   reminded of the 50th anniversary of the guest worker agreement signed\n   between the two countries on Oct. 30, 1961. The program turned out to be\n   quite something else over the years, with more than 3 million Turks living\n   in Germany today. About one-third of them carry German citizenship.\n   After three generations, these people are no longer guests, as they\n   actively contribute to German society, pay their taxes and engage in the\n   communities in which they live. There are some 80,000 Turkish\n   entrepreneurs running businesses in Germany, generating 35 billion euros\n   in turnover annually and employing over 400,000 people. Today many\n   well-educated Germans of Turkish descent occupy senior management\n   positions in big companies operating in Turkey and abroad. In fact, the\n   German government is worried that the cream of the Turkish community is\n   leaving the country and settling in Turkey because of job opportunities\n   and other attractive perks that Germany cannot offer. They consider this\n   brain-drain a huge loss because Germany desperately needs a talented and\n   skilled labor force in many industries.\n   There is also a strong economic bond between Turkey and Germany, with $29\n   billion in trade volume recorded last year -- more than double what Turkey\n   has with France. In the first nine months of this year exports to Germany\n   jumped 29 percent, from $8 billion to $10.5 billion, while imports from\n   Germany increased 31 percent from $12 billion to $17.5 billion in the same\n   period. There are 4,300 German companies operating in Turkey in\n   partnership or joint-venture businesses. The booming Turkish manufacturing\n   industry is one of the major markets for German-engineered industrial\n   machinery.\n   Major German companies are expanding their operations in Turkey,\n   especially in the energy industry. A leading German energy company, RWE,\n   is constructing a natural gas-fired combined-cycle power plant in the\n   Aegean province of Denizli at a cost of 500 million euros. Another German\n   company, E.ON, has similar plans in the Turkish energy market. Wholesale\n   market chain Metro has plans to open 24 new stores next year in Turkey\n   while appliance manufacturer Bosch plans to invest 300 million euros to\n   boost production in the country. A German company with a long-term\n   presence in Turkey, Mercedes-Benz, also has investment plans, following\n   good news that Turkey has become the company's third-largest sales market\n   after Germany and Brazil.\n   A record number of Germans spend their vacations in Turkey, with around 5\n   million visitors expected this year. Turkey welcomes them with an open\n   visa policy, whereas Turks are often confronted with difficulties in\n   getting visas from German consulates. Stories of businessmen who send\n   products to fairs in Munich, Hanover or Frankfurt but cannot travel\n   because their applications are rejected or not processed in time still\n   make the headlines in Turkish dailies. This unfortunately adds to distaste\n   and a mistrust of Germans by the Turkish public. Coupled with this, German\n   authorities' reluctance in effectively dealing with militants belonging to\n   the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and the Revolutionary People's\n   Liberation Party/Front (DHKP/C) in Germany further damage these ties and\n   fuel all sorts of conspiracy theories here in Turkey.\n   For those who prefer to see the glass as half empty, we may surely list\n   more woes here. But I believe all these problems can be overcome or\n   managed at a certain level once Germany realizes that realignment with\n   Turkey from a strategic perspective would serve its own national\n   interests. Only then would attempts by shortsighted German politicians who\n   want to exploit issues like immigration and integration issues for\n   political gain be rendered futile. Until then, we will continue to have\n   our ups and downs with Germany.\n --\n Matthew Powers\n Senior Researcher\n STRATFOR\n 221 W. 6th Street, Suite 400\n Austin, TX 78701\n T: 512-744-4300 | M: 817-975-1037\n www.STRATFOR.com",

Istanbul police chief       \n    Huseyin Capkin said a second device was found next to the dead            \n    attacker's body. Witnesses said that the attacker tried to approach the   \n    police bus in Taksim Square under the guise of asking for directions,     \n    but the explosive device he was carrying detonated a couple of meters     \n    before he reached the bus. Other witnesses said that the suicide          \n    attacker was shot dead by the police after he detonated a smaller         \n    explosive device of some kind.                                            \n    Taksim Square is a crowded area in central Istanbul frequented by both    \n    locals and tourists. As such, police are constantly deployed there to     \n    prevent security threats. The hour of the attack, however, suggests that  \n    police and not civilians were the primary target of the attacker (though  \n    civilian casualties were not intentionally avoided), since Taksim Square  \n    would have been much more crowded with civilians in the afternoon and     \n    the evening. Police, and specifically police buses, have been the         \n    frequent target of attacks in Turkey by the Kurdish militant group the    \n    Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) in recent months. Even though no militant  \n    group has claimed responsibility for the attack yet and the police chief  \n    said the investigation was ongoing, given the target and timing of the    \n    attack right before a unilateral PKK cease-fire was set to end, it is     \n    likely the work of the PKK, though other militant groups such as          \n    Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front (DHKP/C) that use suicide   \n    bombers cannot be ruled out.                                              \n    As STRATFOR has noted, imprisoned PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan has warned   \n    that the unilateral cease-fire declared by the PKK in August and          \n    extended for another month in September could end at the end of October   \n    over the militant group's dissatisfaction with steps taken by the ruling  \n    Justice and Development Party (AKP) to meet its demands for an            \n    indefinite cease-fire. This stance was repeated by several politicians    \n    of the pro-Kurdish Peace and Democracy party (BDP). Moreover, the attack  \n    is similar to a previous attack by the PKK against a bus carrying police  \n    in June 2010, again shortly after the PKK declared that the cease-fire    \n    was over. By attacking the police on the last day of October, when the    \n    cease-fire was set to end, the PKK could be sending a blunt message to    \n    the Turkish government that the cease-fire is now over and police are     \n    among its targets in major cities in addition to military outposts in     \n    southeastern Turkey.                                                      \n    Give us your thoughts                          Read comments on           \n    on this report                                 other reports              \n    For Publication                                Reader Comments            \n    Not For Publication                                                       \n    Terms of Use | Privacy Policy | Contact Us                                \n    (c) Copyright 2010 Stratfor.

O:calan commented on the attack, saying, \"I am\n                     unable to figure out what he is trying to do.\"\n                     Attacks manifest disarray within PKK\n                     Surveillance, monitoring and wiretapping conducted by\n                     intelligence services concluded that the PKK has become\n                     impossible to control, resulting in an increase in the\n                     number of renegade and independent units within the\n                     organization. According to a report prepared by\n                     intelligence services and submitted to the Ministry of\n                     Internal Affairs, many of the terrorist attacks within\n                     the last two years were conducted without the consent of\n                     the leaders of the terrorist organization. It stressed\n                     that radical groups within the organization would\n                     organize attacks whenever the government attempted to\n                     make progress in the settlement of the Kurdish problem.\n                     For example, a vicious attack was carried out by the PKK\n                     on the eve of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's\n                     meeting with Ahmet Tu:rk, the leader of the now-defunct\n                     Democratic Society Party (DTP), who had been denied an\n                     appointment with the prime minister since 2007. The\n                     meeting was scheduled to take place on May 29 but was\n                     cancelled because of the attack two days earlier on a\n                     military outpost in the town of C,ukurca in Hakkari\n                     province, killing seven soldiers. The PKK denied\n                     responsibility for the attack.\n                     The terrorist attack on the Gediktepe outpost in the\n                     town of Semdinli in Hakkari province on June 19 resulted\n                     in the deaths of nine soldiers. This attack was\n                     questioned within the organization itself because it\n                     halted the government contacts with PKK leader O:calan\n                     as part of the Kurdish initiative.\n                     As though all these attacks were not enough, a terrorist\n                     faction from the PKK organized another attack on Sept.\n                     17 despite the cease-fire. They detonated a mine they\n                     planted on a village road in Hakkari with a remote\n                     control device, resulting in the deaths of 10 villagers.\n                     Once again the meeting between the government and the\n                     pro-Kurdish Peace and Democracy Party (BDP), the\n                     successor of the DTP, was postponed due to this\n                     terrorist attack. As a result of the attack, Deputy\n                     Prime Minister Cemil C,ic,ek and Minister of Justice\n                     Sadullah Ergin met with Selahattin Demirtas and Gu:lten\n                     Kisanak, co-chairmen of the BDP, after a two-day delay.\n                     Murat Karayilan (C) said the PKK will end its cease-fire\n                     if the government steps up military operations against\n                     the armed group.\n                     PKK leader warns cease-fire may end\n                     The leader of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party\n                     (PKK) warned on Tuesday it will end its cease-fire if\n                     the government steps up military operations against the\n                     armed group. In an interview with Britain's Independent\n                     newspaper, terrorist leader Murat Karayilan was quoted\n                     as saying time was running out for the Turkish\n                     authorities to pursue a peaceful solution. \"We will wait\n                     another 15 days,\" Karayilan told the newspaper from his\n                     hideout in northern Iraq, where the group is mainly\n                     based. \"If something positive develops, we will extend\n                     the unilateral cease-fire. If there are no concrete\n                     steps, we will evaluate developments and do what we have\n                     to do to defend ourselves.\"\n                     More than 40,000 people, mostly Kurds, have been killed\n                     since the PKK took up arms against Turkey in 1984 for an\n                     independent homeland. The terrorists say they now want\n                     greater rights and autonomy for Turkey's estimated 15\n                     million Kurds. On Aug. 13 the terrorist PKK declared a\n                     one-month, unilateral truce that it then extended for an\n                     indefinite period on Sept. 30. Despite the cease-fire,\n                     there have been fatal clashes between PKK terrorists and\n                     Turkish soldiers in southeastern Turkey.\n                     Karayilan told the paper the Turkish government has used\n                     the cease-fire to \"surround and destroy\" the group. \"If\n                     attacks are carried out, all the Kurdish people will be\n                     part of the defense strategy,\" Karayilan said. \"The\n                     issue is not between the Turkish state and the PKK. It\n                     is between the Turkish state and the Kurdish people.\"\n                     The United States and the European Union, like Turkey,\n                     classify the PKK as a terrorist organization. Istanbul\n                     Today's Zaman with Reuters\n                     PKK-affiliated news agencies confirm that many of the\n                     terrorist attacks in the last two years were led by\n                     provincial group leaders without the approval of the\n                     central PKK leadership. Intelligence services pinpoint\n                     the Dersim Group as the most radical and violent group\n                     within the PKK. This group is led by Kalkan, Bozan Tekin\n                     and Mahir Atakan. There is also the presence of foreign\n                     recruits in this group as well as former members of\n                     militant organizations such as the Revolutionary\n                     People's Liberation Party (DHKPC) and the Liberation\n                     Army of Workers and Peasants in Turkey (TIKKO).\"\n                     Leadership struggle within PKK\n                     Intelligence services conclude that the leadership\n                     structure of the organization is collapsing due to the\n                     polarization stemming from the government-launched\n                     democratization reforms that attempt to solve the\n                     decades-long Kurdish problem. Many of the PKK leaders,\n                     including O:calan, support the viewpoint that the\n                     Kurdish question should be resolved through dialogue and\n                     that both sides should refrain from resorting to\n                     military means. Radical groups within the PKK, however,\n                     argue that views of the jailed leader of the PKK are\n                     shaped and influenced by the ideologies of the Turkish\n                     Republic and consider him to be the government's puppet.\n                     Cemil Bayik and Murat Karayilan lead the groups that\n                     support O:calan's views most passionately. About 1,700\n                     Syrian terrorists who trained in camps in Iraq are led\n                     by Fehman Hu:seyin, and his views clash with those of\n                     Karayilan and Bayik. Karayilan won the fight for\n                     leadership, forcing Hu:seyin to head the armed group\n                     made up of Syrian terrorists in 2009. Later Nurettin\n                     Halef Al Muhammed, aka Sofi Nurettin, who is of Syrian\n                     descent, took over the position from Hu:seyin,\n                     indicating that Hu:seyin's popularity in the\n                     organization is waning. The growing cooperation between\n                     Syria and Turkey on the PKK also made it difficult for\n                     groups of Syrian origin to operate within the PKK.\n                     Bayik, Mustafa Karasu and Ali Haydar Kaytan form the\n                     trio that represents what is referred as the \"Ankara\n                     team\" within the organization. However intelligence\n                     sources have detected that Bayik and Hu:seyin had been\n                     acting in concert.\n                     Deep chaos\n                     Part of the reason why the leadership in the PKK is\n                     locked in a fierce battle is the growing number of\n                     civilian causalities inflicted by the terrorist attacks\n                     staged by the PKK. According to intelligence gathered by\n                     Turkish security agencies, there is no consensus within\n                     the organization on which civilian targets to attack. It\n                     is claimed that Hu:seyin was dismissed from his post\n                     because attacks on civilian targets increased the\n                     terrorist organization's disapproval among the public.\n                     Intercepted communications dispatched by Karayilan to\n                     operatives in Turkey, Iran, Syria and Europe have\n                     revealed signs of deep tension within the organization.\n                     In one communique, Karayilan stressed that \"those\n                     violating the organization's decision for a\n                     de-escalation of violence, which was extended to Oct.\n                     31, 2010, will be relieved and the act of forming\n                     independent factions will be punished in the severest\n                     manner.\"\n                     Zazas severed their ties with PKK\n                     A simmering dispute erupted between Kurds and Zazas, a\n                     Kurdish group that lives primarily in Tunceli, Bingo:l\n                     and Mus provinces but which is regarded as non-Kurdish\n                     by most Kurds because of their different dialect,\n                     according to intelligence reports. Many members of the\n                     PKK were dismissed from key positions within the\n                     organization because they were Zaza, and they were\n                     replaced by Kurdish-Alevi militants. It is estimated\n                     that there are about 300 Zaza people in the terrorist\n                     organization. Yusuf Turhalli, code-named Dr. Ali, was\n                     one of the leaders of the PKK removed from duty because\n                     of his Zaza ethnicity.\n                     After 2007, Selim C,u:ru:kkaya, Sait C,u:ru:kkaya, Aysel\n                     C,u:ru:kkaya and O:mer C,u:ru:kkaya were declared\n                     outsiders by the organization under the pretext that\n                     they were of Zaza descent. O:mer C,u:ku:rkkaya was\n                     killed during a military operation in 1987 when he was\n                     the Tunceli representative of the organization. Sait\n                     C,u:ru:kkaya joined the PKK when he was a student in the\n                     medical faculty of C,ukurova University.

        "body": "\n       Hi Tony,\n   I'm not sure if Emerson operates in Turkey, but in case you do, I wanted\n   to make sure you saw this piece regarding the DHKP-C in Turkey.  About\n   this time last year, Stratfor received information that this group was\n   planning suicide attacks against Western businesses in Turkey and had\n   possibly infiltrated their business operations to further their goals. We\n   don't have any indications that similar attacks were planned in the latest\n   round of violence, though it's certainly worth noting that the group is\n   continuing to plan suicide attacks.  Please let me know if you need any\n   additional information.\n   Best regards,\n   Anya\n                   Turkey: A Failed Suicide Bombing in Ankara\n   April 30, 2009 | 1105 GMT\n   Summary\n   An attempted suicide bombing April 29 against a former Turkish justice\n   minister in Ankara was probably staged by a Marxist-Leninist group that\n   has been quiet since 2006. But it appears there is still a core element of\n   the organization that does have experience planning attacks and could\n   train others to carry them out. The group's tradecraft, however, has\n   proved less than effective.\n   Analysis\n   Former Turkish Justice Minister Hikmet Sami Turk was the target of an\n   attempted suicide bombing April 29 at Bilkent University in Ankara,\n   Turkey. Turk is a member of the law faculty at the university and has\n   taught classes there since he left office in 2002. He was entering a\n   classroom to present a lecture when a woman posing as a student, later\n   identified as Didem Akman, approached him wanting to ask him a question.\n   According to Turk, he dismissed her question and heard a small explosion\n   as he entered the classroom.\n   It appears that the detonator in the improvised explosive device\n   functioned but failed to initiate the device's main charge. (Police report\n   that Akman had one kilogram of explosives strapped to her body.) She also\n   had a handgun that she drew, but she was overpowered by bodyguards and\n   neutralized as a threat. Akman sustained non-life-threatening injuries,\n   but no one else was hurt during the attack.\n   Another suspect, Onur Yilmaz, was arrested at a bus terminal near the\n   university after he was seen in security footage accompanying Akman.\n   Turkish media reported that a third suspect was being questioned in\n   connection with the assassination attempt. According to Reuters, one of\n   the suspects has served time in prison for being connected to the\n   Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front (DHKP/C), a Marxist-Leninist\n   group formed in Turkey in 1978.\n   DHKP/C's primary target set has been Western and state interests in\n   Turkey, including businesses. The group is known to go after retired\n   security and military personnel and to operate across Europe, including in\n   Belgium, The Netherlands, Germany and Austria. The group started using\n   suicide bombings as a tactic in 2001 but has been largely quiet since\n   2006; a government crackdown on the group over the past 10 years has\n   neutralized its most experienced members, including bombmakers. Replacing\n   these technicians is difficult, as bombmaking requires a level of training\n   and technical knowledge that cannot simply be picked up on the Internet.\n   The tactics used in the April 29 attack match previous DHKP/C tactics,\n   including the use of female suicide bombers. Similar operations were\n   carried out by the group in:\n     * May 2003, when a female suicide bomber blew herself up in an Ankara\n       cafe, killing only herself.\n     * June 2004, when a female operative died en route to carrying out a\n       suicide attack in Istanbul, killing only herself.\n     * July 2005, when a man attempting to detonate a suicide vest in front\n       of Turkey's Justice Ministry in Ankara was shot and killed, preventing\n       the attack.\n   While its track record in suicide bombings is quite poor, the DHKP/C is\n   suspected to be behind an Istanbul University bus bombing that killed four\n   people and injured 21 in June 2004.\n   The group's tactics have typically included small-scale bombings and\n   small-arms attacks that could easily be conducted by militants with little\n   training or tactical expertise, and there is no reason to believe the\n   group would stray from these methods of operation. There is also no\n   evidence that the group has developed additional capabilities to carry out\n   larger-scale attacks. While many DHKP/C members have been arrested over\n   the past decade, and while there have been no attacks attributed to the\n   group since mid-2006, it appears that there is still a core element of the\n   organization that does have some rudimentary experience planning attacks\n   and could train others to carry them out. Judging by the attack on April\n   29, the group does not appear to have an accomplished bombmaker.\n   While one attack does not necessarily mean the group has returned from its\n   hiatus, Western businesses should be aware of its presence, given its\n   strongly anti-Western (particularly anti-U.S.) slant. Soft targets such as\n   ex-government officials teaching at a university are a hallmark of the\n   group's tradecraft. On the other hand, another hallmark of the group\n   appears to be faulty explosive devices, which limits its effectiveness.",
